Emailâs a treasure.\nIt feels great to get an email from someone you care about. Or a newsletter you enjoy. Or an update from a service you like. Thatâs how email used to feel all the time.\nBut things changed.\nYou started getting stuff you didnât want from people you didnât know. You lost control over who could reach you. An avalanche of automated emails cluttered everything up.\nAnd Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and Apple just let it happen.\nNow email feels like a chore, rather than a joy. Something you fall behind on. Something you clear out, not cherish. Rather than delight in it, you deal with it.\nAnd yet, email remains a wonder. Thanks to email, people across cultures, continents, countries, cities, and communities communicate every day. Itâs reliable. Itâs simple. It makes it easy for two humans to share their love, and for millions of people to earn a living.\nSo good news, the magicâs still there. Itâs just obscured â buried under a mess of bad habits and neglect. Some from people, some from machines, a lot from email software.\nEmail deserves a dust off. A renovation. Modernized for the way we email today.\nWith HEY, weâve done just that. Itâs a redo, a rethink, a simplified, potent reintroduction of email. A fresh start, the way it should be.\nHEY is our love letter to email and calendars, and weâre sending it to you on the Web, Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android.\n- Jason Fried\n- Co-founder & CEO"}

Whether on someoneâs computer, or a server for everyone, it felt like you owned it. And you did.\nToday, most software is a service. Not owned, but rented. Buying it enters you into a perpetual landlordâtenant agreement. Every month you pay for essentially the same thing you had last month. And if you stop paying, the software stops working. Boom, youâre evicted.\nFor nearly two decades, the SaaS model benefitted landlords handsomely. With routine prayers â and payers â to the Church of Recurring Revenue, valuations shot to the moon on the backs of businesses subscribed at luxury prices for commodity services they had little control over.\nAdd up your SaaS subscriptions last year. You should own that shit by now.\nSaaS still makes sense for many products, but its grip will slip. Installation and administration used to be hopelessly complicated, but selfâhosting tech is simpler now and vastly improved. Plus, IT departments are hungry to run their own IT again, tired of being subservient to Big Techâs reign clouds.\nOnce upon a time you owned what you paid for, you controlled what you depended on, and your privacy and security were your own business. We think itâs that time again.\nIntroducing ONCE, a new line of software products from 37signals.\n- Pay one time, own forever.\n- We write the code, you get to see it.\n- We give you the software, you get to host it.\n- Simple and straightforward, not enterprisey and bloated.\n- For one fixed price. Once.\nSo far there are two ONCE products:\n- Campfire: A group chat system similar to Slack or Teams, but simpler.\n- Writebook: The easiest way on earth to publish a book online.\nIn the early 2000s, we were among the early pioneers leading the industry into the SaaS revolution. Now, 20 years later, we intend to help lead the way out. The postâSaaS era is just around the corner.\nStay tuned.\n- Jason Fried\n- CEO, 37signals\n- jason@37signals.com"}
