Find solutions, get advice, help others. Hi everyone! Here is my setup:I have a main icon component that has all the sizes and the colors available. There is an instance property on the main icon component where designers can select which icon they want (basically a nested component) The nested icon component that is selected changes size and color depending on the settings of the main component Problem:We are adopting a new icon library I went into the icons that already exist and replaced the .svgs I created new icons Now all the instances of icon are not obeying the color property set in the parent and need to manually reset and reconfigured. This is hugely manual and annoying... is there something I can do to avoid all this effort, and why is this happening? Experiencing lag and delays in the MAKE chat on the Figma site when expanding conversations is a common frustration, especially as the text volume increases. The issue seems to worsen over time, specifically when typing into the input field, where the system momentarily freezes before displaying the typed text.Has anyone encountered a similar problem or found a solution to address this performance issue? The main source of inspiration for this idea was to match the keyboard shortcuts themselves to different keyboard layouts. Right now, users who don’t use US keyboards have to memorize the location of the keys, rather than to use the actual character location to be able to use the shortcuts. Those involving this region are primarily the case: ABNT2 layout (Brazil). And here’s an example of confusing shortcuts: Although this problem could be solved by just rebinding the shortcuts to the actual character and not the location on the keyboard, I’ve noticed there are some other issues concerning key bindings. On this forum post, a member of the community asked for help on backing one layer level with a different shortcut from what Figma has right now. This makes the user adapt their workflow to the tool, and not the other way around — and that hinders efficiency. It would be nice if the tool itself provided some sort of customization on this regard. Although being a workaround, Mac users c Hey!My Creator account is active, and I’ve connected my Stripe account. However, I encountered the issue shown in the screenshot while trying to publish my paid design file as a Creator. How can I resolve this?Thank you! I have published 3 sites now using Figma sites. They are all active and accessible...with one major problem… If the user types the name of the site without the www. in front (say they type site.com and hit enter)… there is no redirect automatically enabled and the user gets an “unsecure site” error message. I believe this should be covered automatically by Figma and the automatic SSL… but until such time, I’m wondering if there are DNS settings I need to add to cover this issue.Thanks, Please release an official version for the LINUX operating system because the version on github is unstable and outdated. Please think of your Linux users. It would be a great idea to add the ability to move annotations (сhanging the place). Right now, they’re fixed in place and can overlap other elements. And you cannot change it.What I mean is the ability to reposition an annotation freely while keeping the link to the target object intact.Annotations are a really useful feature—thank you! Previously, I had to create similar functionality using my own objects. Please do not move this offer to another discussion. 🙏Can we move the Figma Annotations (in dev mode) from one Figma project to another?These are different questions. Hi,We have one account, which is owner of 3 teams.Is their a possibility to collaborate on a project, where the users are using their license from their own team?We are now using professional and the owner of the team cannot be the same to connect to an external Team. Best regards,Joost Lauwen Hi,I tried to update my simple Plugin, which I originally added back in 2022. Unfortunately, I got an error which is blocking the update. I also noticed that when I click on the “Permissions” tab the dialog box closes right away. So I don’t know if there is missing something.I also don’t use the E-Mail address anymore, which I added back in 2022. I have no access to it anymore. Instead, I would like to change to the one I use in my account.Any idea what is going wrong?Thanks, Danny Problem:Product Owners (nondesigners) will often times share early work in progress without the designer knowing. This ends up being a headache of dev comments (30+) pinging with comments that designs are not complete or components are not built correctly. Solution:Designer who is the owner of the file can assign specific users/staff so they get all push notifications/emails Reason:To help each team member own accountability for the consequences of their action. If a product owner wants to share an incomplete file to 100+ people in the organization without communicating the designer. Let’s ensure the push notifications/emails get sent to the product owner that initially share a file too early to help respond to each comment. New here so this might be a silly question. I’m trying to make a multi page app using figma make. After creating the first page, I can’t seem to find a way to move on to another page. Is this possible or do I have to create each one separately. Any ideas on ways of doing this? Very low performance speed in Figma Make when the thread reaches large sizes (currently 230+ iterations). All actions in the chat area occur with a significant delay (typing, scrolling, etc.), making it impossible to work.However, the prototype itself works well within FM.Has anyone encountered this? What could be the cause? Could it be related to the power of the laptop? Hello everyone,I’ve run into an issue in Figma prototypes: whenever a component has a Background Blur effect, Smart Animate stops working correctly. I’m looking for any known workarounds or explanations. Scenario A Frame/Component includes: A semi-transparent fill (e.g. white at 20% opacity) Background Blur effect (Radius: 20px) I use Smart Animate to transition this component between different states (variants, interactive component states, or separate frames). Observed Behavior Without blur (same component with only an opaque fill and no blur), all Smart Animate transitions run smoothly. With blur applied, Smart Animate transitions: Jump instantly without interpolation, Or fail to animate entirely. Questions Are there any known Figma limitations or bugs when using Smart Animate on layers with Background Blur? How can I achieve smooth Smart Animate transitions on blurred components without relying on masks or overlays? Could there be a prototype setting or c Hello Figma Community and Team,I'm incredibly excited about the potential of Figma Make and have been eagerly experimenting with its AI capabilities. However, I've run into a significant roadblock when it comes to integrating my team's comprehensive design library, and I'm hoping to get some clarity on the current limitations and what we might expect in the future.Our Setup: A Highly-Structured Design SystemTo provide some context, we've invested a substantial amount of time and effort into building a robust and meticulously organized design system within Figma. This isn't just a collection of components; it's a fully-fledged system that includes: Hundreds of Components: Our library is extensive, containing a wide array of components, from basic elements like buttons and inputs to more complex organisms like cards, sliders, and navigation controls. Meticulous Naming Conventions: Every component, variant, and layer is named with a clear and consistent hierarchy (e.g., input/text/defau Hi, I duplicated 2 files, a library and a design file. The new design file is obviously still attached to the previous library. I want to attach it to the new library. Everything is still exactly the same. I open the library panel in the new design file, add the new library to the file and detach the old one, then I click on “swap library” in order to replace components and styles in the file, but I get this error ID: ba6fb6fe90044b46a5917a85bf89e636. Did this happen to anyone else? If yes anyone found a solution?
